# Backgroud 

OOM occurs Frequently and the jvm is unavailiable but not dead at last. When the OOM occurs at beginning, Full GC occurs always but after a while, no Full GC occurs , the JVM has no response.

# Tools to detect the problem

1. Use jmap -histo to check the objects in use 
2. Use jmap -heap to check how much memory used
3. Use jstat -gcutil to monitor the gc 


#  Consolusion

In a transaction, too many objects is loaded from the DB, each of which needs a lot memory, and the we can not load all Objects into Mem at once.
